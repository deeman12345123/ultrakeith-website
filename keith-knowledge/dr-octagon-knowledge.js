[Verse 1]
I crank up lyrical flows, spit Spats, what's that?
The pattern records, don't touch the DATs, yo
Check out the pro-skills, medic fulfills
Contact react to style, I'm back—you lack
Channels and handles, Automator's on the panels
Turning knobs, you slobs suckers like Baskin-Robbs
Carvel don't tell—your whole crew is ice cream fudge
Rappers that budge, making moves step in grooves
And ride the pace like at thirty-three dark shades
Now you seeing me
Rap moves on to the year three thousand

[Hook]
Three thousand!
Three thousand!
Three thousand!

[Verse 2]
Let me shuffle—red, red, red, see the black card, it ain't hard
Pick and choose, you lose, oops, you lost
Check out the boss on Broadway down to walkways
Suckers with mics that end up with tooth decay
I, the Doctor, stop ya, in your world rock ya
Heads bop, forever tunes and they won't stop like hip-hop
Keeps growing, sick of- sick of showing
Scratches in mattress, business, money, reattaches worldwide
Deep inside stops the diamond rocks
In a million world, billion world, quadrillion world

As studies have shown; participator acts walk up, clog up
And mess up water down the sound that comes from the ghetto
In the middle the core you tour, explore experience
What is real you feel, changing ways
Commercial rap's in the grave, stuff on disc that's very wack
That you saved, you think it's good won't go platinum
Or even turn wood, sell the cassette
Your homie's tape deck gets wet
You my pet, my poodle chicken noodle's on the rise
Open your eyes and see my life
Rap moves on to the year three thousand!

Equator ex my chance to flex skills on Ampex
With power meters and heaters gauge anti-freeze
Octagon oxygen, aluminum intoxicants
More ways to blow blood cells in your face
React with four bombs and six fire missiles
Armed with seven rounds of space doo-doo pistols
You may not believe, living on the Earth planet
My skin is green and silver, forehead looking mean
Astronauts get played, tough like the ukelele
As I move in rockets, overriding, levels
Nothing's aware, same data, same system

Power production is greatly increased, magnetic fields
Velocity of projectiles, electro-liquid experiments
Theoretical observances and critical procedures, cool
To 77 Kelvins by submerging steel cylinders
Secure capacitated it in the cryogenic containing the crude samples
One millimeter in diameter
Since the last explosion, December 3rd, 1992
Reinforce mixing copper nickel-beryllium oxide
Concentric layers, proportional carbon density of the radian
It is therefore existent if it does not produce contradictory statements
Or quantum wave functions, mechanic mind out of matter
This behaviour is accompanied by conscious experience
Remains as perplexing as ever
Ask Copernicus about pushing limits

Change strange and detour fought more
Minds with signs of minds on eight by ten
Class when atomic lines
You keepin' deep thought by but my planet court
Rehearsal is a must, lest my vital is a point to fuss

Edge dislocation
Specifically, how materials deform and ultimately fail under stress
Depends on science immobile
Epoxy old-style composites
New conductors maximum amp use much finer filaments
18 percent of volume -269 degrees
Celsius, a record for resistive electromagnets
A hybrid design, 730,000 gauss
For all types of DC resonance absorption
Flowing through 15,000 100-watt light bulbs
Tremendous heat is generated driven by direct
But not oscillating current
Extremely powerful, fascinating
Engineering reflections, acoustic death by analysis
Vulnerable to legal challenge
High exposure requires mental protection, replica
Artificial dynamic Microsoft tech
Heavy black cables, mobile robot demanding battery power
Acids found in Drosophila, the master gene
[Outro: Sample]
"My family left Latvia during the occupation. We were hunted
Like dogs!"

Chewbacca's not here—I'mma do it for you circumcised
Niggas don't realize my format is a palm spectrum
To damage any rectum
This is the real dinosaur funk which permitted G-Funk
To play anally through the trunk a digital master
Was given to Sam Cooke and Jimmy Castor
Kurt Cobain was here but Doc Oc' has novacaine
Theoretically keepin' puppies and the pedigree
Small fetus brought Santa Claus to greet us
Rappers know I'm equipped with Clorox
And chemicals that'll burn off your lip
Intestines investments hide money in your stomach
Who can stop Pepto Bismol?
Only a Gremlin eatin' in Larry Parker like Gizmo
As Dr. Octagonecologyst girls open legs for beer kegs
French toast and herbs were covered with giant eggs
Livin' small, people unequal challenge my thoughts
No station or radio will understand
The perfect enzyme is me with your brain in my other hand

MP4, six spacecraft in the mix, kissin Mary J. Blige
On Earth was quite normal
As Dr. Octagon, walkin' through a polygon
My first impression was to give patients a lesson
Who's the best to put me to the test
I'll battle Ultramagnetic, my own self as well
Two mirrors in the clear, I'm floating deep in the atmosphere
Through Los Angeles heights I'll damage Hollywood lights
Women know my sex computer condoms humpin' on Ampex
My number 2-7-5-49-69 disconnected
My first black robot
Space connected while you listen to Keith Sweat (meow)
Your brain is caught up in a net
Two million thousand three billion wack records in the solar
The system's out of reach, niggas try to preach
Why you tryin to act fly walkin' up Venice Beach?
Zapp, like Roger, my funk is powerful than Troutman
Seven years ago like California was tooken from Mexico

Yo chief administrator, suck my oil

[Verse 1: Sir Menelik]
The plane managed to land, the skeleton at the controls
A place called the Twilight Zone
Are extraterrestrials able to accomplish this?
I will explain but you'd become more puzzled at the possibilities
Earth ending trilogies, wacky stuff
Like gas passing dinosaurs
Morlocks drawing circles blindfolded
Gave a lady some wrinkle cream out of rat poop
You might just laugh so hard your skull cracks
Brain spills thick blood shooting out like a champagne cork
Females so horny and mean, sucking scales off of live rattlesnakes
My boy gave his girl money for groceries, she got a new hairdo
Women like this could even make the devil commit suicide
Hung from a tree on Johannesburg with no parachute
Big-Bigfoot captured by UFO's
Haloes were found, at the landing sites
Vanishing victims, kept alive on metal examining tables
Ex-Experts baffled they could survive the caustic exposure
To laser scalpels, green berets
Growing cold heads in mechanical wombs
Radioactive constant temperature circular appendages
Cripples start shaking sending distress signals
We're not alone in the Twilight Zone

Super disease your brain is more hysterical
My urine see paralyze your ability with space codes
Electrodes you're ready for a pap smear

Steam of Legion, to burn up in your anal region

Mathematical parabola, ACT test and just ex-plorating
The creative arctic regions, or isolating cockpit

To a place an oasis in a nebula, Earth
Universal charting unseen atmosphere
Requesting assistance, I speed through waves like a Concorde SST
Then open aperture
The shape of Octagon selects forward morphing it's the vertical Frankenstein
Prototype of like Kevorkian
Mind pedestrian controls
Spend elevation gobble the ignorant supersonic cruise
Hidin' to think, focus psychosis with Von Blowford
Black lotus releases when life is flailing external
Terminal update, thermal conducted power source supplied
Man on the moon pumps amps, or souped up cable boxes
Getting up impossible

My impeccable caliber that makes your vision blur

Voodoo arrangers with the kids Power Rangers
Make me see other men, gorillas masturbating with human strangers
Legally through court, you're stung by a genital wart
Chlamydia, through the city-a
Los Angeles Texas has a serpent that's urgent
For the mass appeal biomedical test your rectum
Squeezing in banana peels
Outwards backwards towards Boston
It's costing androids leaving humans with hemorrhoids
Thinking more of what they can't explore, like
The cartoon Donald Duck is given fellatio on the floor
With Reed Richards, looking at The Thing's naked pictures
Taking Ex-Lax to relax with the needle and thread

What type of partners you have and who's your first lover
He never turned you around, showed you doggystyle
We got some things in common, honey, let's talk awhile
Did he lick you there? Percolate your atmosphere?
I got a mask at home, boots, and some leather gear
How about me and you in black? I'm hittin' from the back
Tail in my face, and all juicy, brown booty

Bring pet mice, and scare your sister with a gray mouse
Then drop him under the bed, and leave him there dead
Take out your parakeet, with scissors, clip his head
Then get the charcoal, whassup, burn your dog's legs
Walk by the barbershop, and hit the glass with eggs
Then go in the club and dance, mix the alcohol
Great with roach spray, here's a drink, have a ball
Dance to the music, watch it party pooper
Yeah, you know...
I'm destructive (4X)

Bash in your head with ten full cans of Campbell's soup
I'm on the roof and I let the pigeons out the chicken coop
Stole your checks, and flush money down the toilet bowl
Look at the frog, he's gone too down the commode
War paint on the carpet, your fur was my target
Give the baby some gum, a pack of Bubble Yum
Stick it in the rugs, smearing green lightening bugs
All around the walls, down the halls
Checking out doodoo on flame pits, niggas with they armpits
Down, smellin funky, check out the junkie, spit
I'm destructive!! (4X)

[Outro]
Like a green red blue reindeer, dead lying down with a fawn
Copulating, having sex
Mating with a babboon with buffalo wings
Hahahahaha
Like Hitler, the German Shepherd, coming with a brown
Spotty moose you sound as soft as a goose
We all hang with tickets for Van Halen
Gorefest, Autopsy, Def Leppard, and Spazz
C'mon, drop the jazz Grateful Dead, rock with it

Model H3OC, plus another thousand
Kickin lyrics for ASCAP, brothers I be housin
Splittin publishin, gainin points, rappin back again
My unique style, and certain words, watch me make em blend
Manifest bandwidth, spread out, with computer data
Suckers don't know, acute intelligence, what's the matter
Solo fiend, I cut your legs with the guillotine
Snap back, rip utensils props in your paperback
Gettin rectums, doin jobs like I'm Dr. Giggles
Servin em well, I stop their anals up with pickles
With operation to give, the room an atmosphere
Cyclops will walk, Frankenstein still standin here
Watch the hand out the ground, Chiller

Right in front of your building with live bear every year
Takin horns, from moose and wild bulls and capricorns
I got your face in the frame, inside the living room
While kids watch 13, I'm in the back scope and zoom
Sesame Street, you play that beat, I'mma step to Pete
With nuclear bombs, and word to mom, I'mma blow his arms
Six shot rhyme, my forty-four is made by Charter Arms
I put some diss in the steps, and damage all your reps
Get off the hooks in project style like Bernard Goetz
What's the matter, kid you scared, come and do the bid
Inmates'll damage your tapes, you're nervous liftin weights

Spittin flim-flam, rappers still smokin crack
Suckers get pantylined, and spots on the hiney crack

With priests, I'm from the Church of the Operating Room
With the strikes of force, scalpels since the holocaust
I do indeed in greed, explore meet the patients
Back to brooms with the nurse with the voodoo curse
Holding up office lights, standing at huge heights
Back and forth, left wing swing to North
East and South with blood pouring down your mouth
I come prepared with the white suit and stethoscope
Listen to your heartbeat—delete, beep, beep, beep!
Your insurance is high, but my price is cheap
Look at the lamp...

Blue Flowers! (tapping lightly at the treetops)
Growing by the purple pond in the purple pastures

Cybernetic microscopes and metal antidotes
Two telescopes that magnify size of a roach
Three computers, the cup of coffee planted with my hand and
Astroplanet detached, turn on rear foggers
Cut the light on the kid, and turn the bright on
Supersonic waves combine and burn as brainwaves
I see the mascot of evil he's not Kneivel
Shakespeare's gone don't even think about it
Yes, as I'm going to the park, I see...

Adjustable physical chemical properties overall size

Of above indicated enzymes may neutralize free radicals
Which in turn triggers an immune response to generate the human body
As the parasite pumps its muscular pharens and plugs from the mucus
Secreting germs to destroy, hydroperoxide generated by the human host

These shaded translucent polygons rise from a point of ignition
Shrinking until they wink out, interactively appears to those

Can science achieve a unified theory of a complex systems?
Permanently skeptical of friends of the institute
External faculty, that routinely exerts selective pressure
By killing less fit programs, life evolves, in cyberspace
Green and blue objects in self-replicating lightning
Represents random mutations completely chaotic systems
Such as turbulent fluids or heating gases are formless
Truly, complex amino bond traders appear at the border
Between individual order {?} torturing stick to terms compiled
Among a list of 31 ways to define, grammatical
The degree of universality in a language required to describe a style
Effective
The degree of regular, rather than random, information
For instance, complexity equals the capacity of an unexpecting observer
Thermodynamic depth, the amount of resources to put back a system
Together from scratch, pioneering, engineering, cybernetic cellular calculus
Cooperating flatly contradicting predictable circumstances
Including uranium-235, is obtained, for bomb fission

Like Hailey's Comet, computers that'll make you vomit
CHANGE the earth cell saliva runnin' in your mouth, gastric juice
More beyond since Mother Goose
Created shapes the first man with hairy apes
Seven, thirty-five, P.M.E.T.D
Over props sprayin' crops like D-D-T
The first arrival of Apollo 13 beamin' down through raindrops
While pieces hit the scene
Atomic formats complex playin' on, silver DAT's
Guarded by sonic steel and takin' off by Thundercats
You're on the avenue wishin' you could see me
My forcefield shuts in two eyes seein' three of me
Illusions, fusion, particle gas confusion
I run space shuttles and me I'm gettin' the solution
Takin' off in bold, meet me at the black hole
Enzymes for your mind seems to move in tighter showin' you the spectrums

Psychology, is not applied biology
Nor is biology, applied chemistry
Level independent some degree of the levels above and below captive
Intricacies after a frenzy of interest, theories collapse
Perhaps concepts could not explain
Irreversible concrete philosophical developments
Such an analysis, indicate, emergence
Naturally in simple society
The payoff matrix summarizes the scoring
Absolute software, thirty arc second strategy
Like drops of water floating in a void
Unstable atoms orbit distant clouds, nuclear having, excess neutrinos
All protons teeter, on the edges of nuclear stability
Or at drift lines under the stress, some develop a halo
Beo-radioactivity isotopes exotic
Depending on their velocities and charges narrow momentum distribution
Forces directly reflected, electric, magnetic
C-22 ally 11, escape particle with vomit
Properties of the nucleus, V8
And a sun that produces easily detected, neutrinos
Much less than predicted standards can be designed can be ended
And it provides for continuing evolution of technology
While remaining compatible with existing, applications
And programming language

The sun is over there and nothin' gets between us
You're the earthling, try to float, it's a mental thing
I got oxygen, eight hours of space time, you must return quick
Please, don't waste time, you could die out here
The moon is a place of fear
With two minutes on the planet you're only bound to panic
We have no extras, bags et cetera
Whenever your obstacles backfires—you inflate in seconds
Nervous like flat tires, one second's left to orbit his last breath
Telecast to Earth a astronaut didn't make it
We move beyond your navigation and level of 32
Switchin' like channel 13
Late at night you see a blank screen
Focus on "The Outer Limits" but you're back on stage
On the line of scrimmage, I'm out here, come and get me
With no equipment call the President
Not even rocks or fossils left
Damaged by, the elements

My over compressed thoughts and waves make you get live
You are the patient, and I – your black doctor
Medical bills, insurance, cash in the ceiling
Dioxalyn fingerprints here ever since
I got my white suit pressed, out the cleaners
X-Ray shades with hard shoes and some razor blades
Who's the brother that's sick, and needs the operation?
Bullets removed from your head, Grand Central Station
I gotta cut off your ear, first behind your neck
Rip out the stomach, and open rectums to dissect
Shine the light inside, roaches crawling in your throat
I don't have tools, my hammer's dull, my drill is broke

Seeking Kimbles and bits, a girl with small tits
Talking to herself, her dog, and having rabid fits
Green fly soup is on the way from the kitchen, troop
Looking at TB tuberculous on the window post
Ten dead dogs, a brown fox in the comatose
With no reps, I put more needles in they kneecaps
Some primitive screws in mind, yes and perhaps
A little sprinkle of Clorox in their vocal box
Some Pepto-Bismol, Pepsi-Cola, pack of Pop Rocks

Shark Man? *chuckling*
Judging from his appearance, that's the most appropriate name I could come up with for him
I hate this kid

It had the body of a shark, and the arms and face of a man?
That's the chap
Holy jumping jackfish!"

I, myself— Mr. Gerbik: half-shark, half-man, skin like alligator
Carrying a dead walrus
Ooh, check it

[Verse 1: Mr. Gerbik]
With my white eyes, gray hair, face is sky-blue yellow
Sideburns react, my skin is colored lilac
My skin turn orange and green in the limousine
People think I'm mixed with shark, drinking gasoline
Underwater I breathe with lizards on my sleeve
Walking down Hollywood Boulevard with a credit card
Three alligators behind me, feel my skin is hard
Transvestites, and people watch space parasites
I left his head in the store, legs in the street
Body on Wilcox, with blood dripping off my feet
LAPD through gray clouds couldn't see me
I first turned rainbow, closed my eyes, watch my brain glow
People got scared and ranned away they think I'm weird
I was born this way, halfsharkalligator

The water is deep, and it takes a supreme feat of strength to swim through the water plants while dragging a two hundred and fifty pound sambar... The crocodile's teeth are designed to seize and hold prey, not to cut through skin. During all the hours the sambar lay in the water they are unable to penetrate the deer's tough hide. The crocodiles make a few token objections; but in the end give up without the struggle

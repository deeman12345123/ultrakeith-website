[Verse 1]
I crank up lyrical flows, spit Spats, what's that?
The pattern records, don't touch the DATs, yo
Check out the pro-skills, medic fulfills
Contact react to style, I'm back—you lack
Channels and handles, Automator's on the panels
Turning knobs, you slobs suckers like Baskin-Robbs
Carvel don't tell—your whole crew is ice cream fudge
Rappers that budge, making moves step in grooves
And ride the pace like at thirty-three dark shades
Now you seeing me
Rap moves on to the year three thousand

[Hook]
Three thousand!
Three thousand!
Three thousand!

[Verse 2]
Let me shuffle—red, red, red, see the black card, it ain't hard
Pick and choose, you lose, oops, you lost
Check out the boss on Broadway down to walkways
Suckers with mics that end up with tooth decay
I, the Doctor, stop ya, in your world rock ya
Heads bop, forever tunes and they won't stop like hip-hop
Keeps growing, sick of- sick of showing
Scratches in mattress, business, money, reattaches worldwide
Deep inside stops the diamond rocks
In a million world, billion world, quadrillion world

As studies have shown; participator acts walk up, clog up
And mess up water down the sound that comes from the ghetto
In the middle the core you tour, explore experience
What is real you feel, changing ways
Commercial rap's in the grave, stuff on disc that's very wack
That you saved, you think it's good won't go platinum
Or even turn wood, sell the cassette
Your homie's tape deck gets wet
You my pet, my poodle chicken noodle's on the rise
Open your eyes and see my life
Rap moves on to the year three thousand!

Equator ex my chance to flex skills on Ampex
With power meters and heaters gauge anti-freeze
Octagon oxygen, aluminum intoxicants
More ways to blow blood cells in your face
React with four bombs and six fire missiles
Armed with seven rounds of space doo-doo pistols
You may not believe, living on the Earth planet
My skin is green and silver, forehead looking mean
Astronauts get played, tough like the ukelele
As I move in rockets, overriding, levels
Nothing's aware, same data, same system

Power production is greatly increased, magnetic fields
Velocity of projectiles, electro-liquid experiments
Theoretical observances and critical procedures, cool
To 77 Kelvins by submerging steel cylinders
Secure capacitated it in the cryogenic containing the crude samples
One millimeter in diameter
Since the last explosion, December 3rd, 1992
Reinforce mixing copper nickel-beryllium oxide
Concentric layers, proportional carbon density of the radian
It is therefore existent if it does not produce contradictory statements
Or quantum wave functions, mechanic mind out of matter
This behaviour is accompanied by conscious experience
Remains as perplexing as ever
Ask Copernicus about pushing limits

Change strange and detour fought more
Minds with signs of minds on eight by ten
Class when atomic lines
You keepin' deep thought by but my planet court
Rehearsal is a must, lest my vital is a point to fuss

Edge dislocation
Specifically, how materials deform and ultimately fail under stress
Depends on science immobile
Epoxy old-style composites
New conductors maximum amp use much finer filaments
18 percent of volume -269 degrees
Celsius, a record for resistive electromagnets
A hybrid design, 730,000 gauss
For all types of DC resonance absorption
Flowing through 15,000 100-watt light bulbs
Tremendous heat is generated driven by direct
But not oscillating current
Extremely powerful, fascinating
Engineering reflections, acoustic death by analysis
Vulnerable to legal challenge
High exposure requires mental protection, replica
Artificial dynamic Microsoft tech
Heavy black cables, mobile robot demanding battery power
Acids found in Drosophila, the master gene
[Outro: Sample]
"My family left Latvia during the occupation. We were hunted
Like dogs!"

Chewbacca's not here—I'mma do it for you circumcised
Niggas don't realize my format is a palm spectrum
To damage any rectum
This is the real dinosaur funk which permitted G-Funk
To play anally through the trunk a digital master
Was given to Sam Cooke and Jimmy Castor
Kurt Cobain was here but Doc Oc' has novacaine
Theoretically keepin' puppies and the pedigree
Small fetus brought Santa Claus to greet us
Rappers know I'm equipped with Clorox
And chemicals that'll burn off your lip
Intestines investments hide money in your stomach
Who can stop Pepto Bismol?
Only a Gremlin eatin' in Larry Parker like Gizmo
As Dr. Octagonecologyst girls open legs for beer kegs
French toast and herbs were covered with giant eggs
Livin' small, people unequal challenge my thoughts
No station or radio will understand
The perfect enzyme is me with your brain in my other hand

MP4, six spacecraft in the mix, kissin Mary J. Blige
On Earth was quite normal
As Dr. Octagon, walkin' through a polygon
My first impression was to give patients a lesson
Who's the best to put me to the test
I'll battle Ultramagnetic, my own self as well
Two mirrors in the clear, I'm floating deep in the atmosphere
Through Los Angeles heights I'll damage Hollywood lights
Women know my sex computer condoms humpin' on Ampex
My number 2-7-5-49-69 disconnected
My first black robot
Space connected while you listen to Keith Sweat (meow)
Your brain is caught up in a net
Two million thousand three billion wack records in the solar
The system's out of reach, niggas try to preach
Why you tryin to act fly walkin' up Venice Beach?
Zapp, like Roger, my funk is powerful than Troutman
Seven years ago like California was tooken from Mexico

Yo chief administrator, suck my oil

[Verse 1: Sir Menelik]
The plane managed to land, the skeleton at the controls
A place called the Twilight Zone
Are extraterrestrials able to accomplish this?
I will explain but you'd become more puzzled at the possibilities
Earth ending trilogies, wacky stuff
Like gas passing dinosaurs
Morlocks drawing circles blindfolded
Gave a lady some wrinkle cream out of rat poop
You might just laugh so hard your skull cracks
Brain spills thick blood shooting out like a champagne cork
Females so horny and mean, sucking scales off of live rattlesnakes
My boy gave his girl money for groceries, she got a new hairdo
Women like this could even make the devil commit suicide
Hung from a tree on Johannesburg with no parachute
Big-Bigfoot captured by UFO's
Haloes were found, at the landing sites
Vanishing victims, kept alive on metal examining tables
Ex-Experts baffled they could survive the caustic exposure
To laser scalpels, green berets
Growing cold heads in mechanical wombs
Radioactive constant temperature circular appendages
Cripples start shaking sending distress signals
We're not alone in the Twilight Zone

Super disease your brain is more hysterical
My urine see paralyze your ability with space codes
Electrodes you're ready for a pap smear

Steam of Legion, to burn up in your anal region

Mathematical parabola, ACT test and just ex-plorating
The creative arctic regions, or isolating cockpit

To a place an oasis in a nebula, Earth
Universal charting unseen atmosphere
Requesting assistance, I speed through waves like a Concorde SST
Then open aperture
The shape of Octagon selects forward morphing it's the vertical Frankenstein
Prototype of like Kevorkian
Mind pedestrian controls
Spend elevation gobble the ignorant supersonic cruise
Hidin' to think, focus psychosis with Von Blowford
Black lotus releases when life is flailing external
Terminal update, thermal conducted power source supplied
Man on the moon pumps amps, or souped up cable boxes
Getting up impossible

My impeccable caliber that makes your vision blur

Voodoo arrangers with the kids Power Rangers
Make me see other men, gorillas masturbating with human strangers
Legally through court, you're stung by a genital wart
Chlamydia, through the city-a
Los Angeles Texas has a serpent that's urgent
For the mass appeal biomedical test your rectum
Squeezing in banana peels
Outwards backwards towards Boston
It's costing androids leaving humans with hemorrhoids
Thinking more of what they can't explore, like
The cartoon Donald Duck is given fellatio on the floor
With Reed Richards, looking at The Thing's naked pictures
Taking Ex-Lax to relax with the needle and thread

What type of partners you have and who's your first lover
He never turned you around, showed you doggystyle
We got some things in common, honey, let's talk awhile
Did he lick you there? Percolate your atmosphere?
I got a mask at home, boots, and some leather gear
How about me and you in black? I'm hittin' from the back
Tail in my face, and all juicy, brown booty

Bring pet mice, and scare your sister with a gray mouse
Then drop him under the bed, and leave him there dead
Take out your parakeet, with scissors, clip his head
Then get the charcoal, whassup, burn your dog's legs
Walk by the barbershop, and hit the glass with eggs
Then go in the club and dance, mix the alcohol
Great with roach spray, here's a drink, have a ball
Dance to the music, watch it party pooper
Yeah, you know...

Bash in your head with ten full cans of Campbell's soup
I'm on the roof and I let the pigeons out the chicken coop
Stole your checks, and flush money down the toilet bowl
Look at the frog, he's gone too down the commode
War paint on the carpet, your fur was my target
Give the baby some gum, a pack of Bubble Yum
Stick it in the rugs, smearing green lightening bugs
All around the walls, down the halls
Checking out doodoo on flame pits, niggas with they armpits
Down, smellin funky, check out the junkie, spit
I'm destructive!! (4X)

Like a green red blue reindeer, dead lying down with a fawn
Copulating, having sex
Mating with a babboon with buffalo wings
Hahahahaha
Like Hitler, the German Shepherd, coming with a brown
Spotty moose you sound as soft as a goose
We all hang with tickets for Van Halen
Gorefest, Autopsy, Def Leppard, and Spazz

My unique style, and certain words, watch me make em blend
Manifest bandwidth, spread out, with computer data
Suckers don't know, acute intelligence, what's the matter
Solo fiend, I cut your legs with the guillotine
Snap back, rip utensils props in your paperback
Gettin rectums, doin jobs like I'm Dr. Giggles
Servin em well, I stop their anals up with pickles
With operation to give, the room an atmosphere
Cyclops will walk, Frankenstein still standin here
Watch the hand out the ground, Chiller

While kids watch 13, I'm in the back scope and zoom
Sesame Street, you play that beat, I'mma step to Pete
With nuclear bombs, and word to mom, I'mma blow his arms
Six shot rhyme, my forty-four is made by Charter Arms
I put some diss in the steps, and damage all your reps
Get off the hooks in project style like Bernard Goetz

With the strikes of force, scalpels since the holocaust
I do indeed in greed, explore meet the patients
Back to brooms with the nurse with the voodoo curse
Holding up office lights, standing at huge heights
Back and forth, left wing swing to North
East and South with blood pouring down your mouth
I come prepared with the white suit and stethoscope
Listen to your heartbeat—delete, beep, beep, beep!
Your insurance is high, but my price is cheap
Look at the lamp...

Cut the light on the kid, and turn the bright on

Can science achieve a unified theory of a complex systems?
Permanently skeptical of friends of the institute
External faculty, that routinely exerts selective pressure
By killing less fit programs, life evolves, in cyberspace
Green and blue objects in self-replicating lightning
Represents random mutations completely chaotic systems
Such as turbulent fluids or heating gases are formless
Truly, complex amino bond traders appear at the border
Between individual order {?} torturing stick to terms compiled
Among a list of 31 ways to define, grammatical
The degree of universality in a language required to describe a style
Effective
The degree of regular, rather than random, information
For instance, complexity equals the capacity of an unexpecting observer
Thermodynamic depth, the amount of resources to put back a system
Together from scratch, pioneering, engineering, cybernetic cellular calculus
Cooperating flatly contradicting predictable circumstances
Including uranium-235, is obtained, for bomb fission

While pieces hit the scene
Atomic formats complex playin' on, silver DAT's
Guarded by sonic steel and takin' off by Thundercats
You're on the avenue wishin' you could see me
My forcefield shuts in two eyes seein' three of me
Illusions, fusion, particle gas confusion
I run space shuttles and me I'm gettin' the solution

Psychology, is not applied biology
Nor is biology, applied chemistry
Level independent some degree of the levels above and below captive
Intricacies after a frenzy of interest, theories collapse
Perhaps concepts could not explain
Irreversible concrete philosophical developments
Such an analysis, indicate, emergence
Naturally in simple society
The payoff matrix summarizes the scoring
Absolute software, thirty arc second strategy
Like drops of water floating in a void
Unstable atoms orbit distant clouds, nuclear having, excess neutrinos
All protons teeter, on the edges of nuclear stability
Or at drift lines under the stress, some develop a halo
Beo-radioactivity isotopes exotic
Depending on their velocities and charges narrow momentum distribution
Forces directly reflected, electric, magnetic
C-22 ally 11, escape particle with vomit
Properties of the nucleus, V8
And a sun that produces easily detected, neutrinos
Much less than predicted standards can be designed can be ended
And it provides for continuing evolution of technology
While remaining compatible with existing, applications
And programming language

Please, don't waste time, you could die out here
The moon is a place of fear
With two minutes on the planet you're only bound to panic
We have no extras, bags et cetera
Whenever your obstacles backfires—you inflate in seconds
Nervous like flat tires, one second's left to orbit his last breath
Telecast to Earth a astronaut didn't make it
We move beyond your navigation and level of 32
Switchin' like channel 13
Late at night you see a blank screen
Focus on "The Outer Limits" but you're back on stage
On the line of scrimmage, I'm out here, come and get me
With no equipment call the President
Not even rocks or fossils left
Damaged by, the elements

You are the patient, and I – your black doctor

Dioxalyn fingerprints here ever since
I got my white suit pressed, out the cleaners
X-Ray shades with hard shoes and some razor blades
Who's the brother that's sick, and needs the operation?
Bullets removed from your head, Grand Central Station
I gotta cut off your ear, first behind your neck
Rip out the stomach, and open rectums to dissect
Shine the light inside, roaches crawling in your throat

Looking at TB tuberculous on the window post
Ten dead dogs, a brown fox in the comatose
With no reps, I put more needles in they kneecaps
Some primitive screws in mind, yes and perhaps

Underwater I breathe with lizards on my sleeve
Walking down Hollywood Boulevard with a credit card
Three alligators behind me, feel my skin is hard
Transvestites, and people watch space parasites
I left his head in the store, legs in the street
Body on Wilcox, with blood dripping off my feet

The water is deep, and it takes a supreme feat of strength to swim through the water plants while dragging a two hundred and fifty pound sambar... The crocodile's teeth are designed to seize and hold prey, not to cut through skin. During all the hours the sambar lay in the water they are unable to penetrate the deer's tough hide.

Convertible beater bug lover
Undercover in a romance with this beautiful type of mama
The porno star genre
Body like Takara
Drive by I’ma hit that tomorrow
She get that butt bit off like piranha
Doctor’s laying out with the black briefcase in the sauna
Rock call me the one-man Nirvana
The crowd throw out they vaginas
Rappers wait onstage with sweat in their pantyliners
I haul hogs from San Francisco to South Carolina
Paint rap in the butt crack with a good primer
Over all the famous panties
We take a leak on your best designers
Y’all block reppin it with second hand rhymers
From Atlantic to Capitol
Even Def Jam I laugh at you
Dawkins dunk the ball over your mama like Daryl
Seahawker stalker
Wear my helmet in the VW
I’m in love with you
Clean the engine you know how I cruise

Penicillin villain and reactivate forcing
Fly around with utensils reporting
No dimension while recording
Doctor bounce the basketballs and the heights
While they're wearing Jordans
Your girl drooling with sweat pouring
Sonic music laser rear around your ears with the chorus
The beef patty from golden crust kick like Chuck Norris
Another white horse in the black yard without the harness
Chariots carry me like Washington, George write the prescription
This ain't demented, people say I'm using antibiotics
With no sentences, Automator in the galaxy, gladiator infinite
Washing my sneakers off with Pepsodent new world experiments

[Hook: Dr Octagon]
Doctor headed to the hospital, i'm in orbit

October is the month of the gynaecologist manhunt
Celery and carrots with nurses piercing they breasts
With double bed bunks
The opium funnel watch them get close to each other and cuddle
Cadillac big enough to drive through a butthole
Honor me on the wall, pen and scroll
Reanimate, hold your head in your hand while I bake oatmeal Cookies in that stove, snoop a pepper on your dog with oregano
This is fumigated gas coming out the mixing bowl, so original
Let's go inside with the way my legal pad paper fall

Radical vibes keep us alive
Those who play Charles blind need to be
Receiving the music like a critic with a crooked hairline
The pad is the bullets, the pen did the crime
Wearing my insulated condoms going overtime
I sketch out and draw
Ladies with china ways walking with their pants off
Would you be mad if Octagon vision saw them in dancehall
I plans with the ski hat and my scarf
Me and Dan bust a U-Y with the bass guitar
In the double R, Egor looking inside bazaar
Show for ho the parrot on his shoulder
The bird peck til he sober

Detonated format, the aristocrat
The United States and Europe can all interact

We can all watch on IMAX, watch the music industry have a climax
I remember girls used to play scrotum like a hi-hat
Freaking the wheelchair, where's ya thigh at
Me and Automator tour, walking through Iraq
Pterodactyl, dinosaur medicated from awe from penzor
I been where roaches been crawl
Watch insects have sex while vocals come from the larynx
Girls reeds look good when they play my clarinet
Everybody dumbed down on social network
The download stealing my medical concepts
Dr. octagon holding Lady Gaga's baby in a private jet
On all fours, I see Katy Perry at her best
The Wolfman calling 300 pounds up to his chest

Go sit in Starbucks come get these burgers and fries
Y'all haunted by the dog, you can't see my burgundy eyes
Riding over the top of the city with a helicopter with cherry tabletop pies
The government wanna buy my mind
Obama and Michelle watch the spacecraft park by the Whitehouse parallel
Rappers sit up in the room like the doll Annabelle
JVC and Sony called and asked me what Panasonic sell
The Deltones industrial
Throwing parakeets out the window with dollar bills
The complaints skyrocket the maniac dr. in Hollywood Hills
Offer respect to a Phil Spector copycat rapping with his legs in rinse wrap
A brain surgeon without license doing mal pract'
Hitting harder and harder with vial tracks
Alligators in the pool release stew and plack
Boa constrictors in the tank with the light blue rats

Autopsy in the lobby
The vampire party, girls like when I spray my body with Bacari
Public hair cleaning the carwash the majority
Other groups sending me I'm going to see Ari
Kindergarten I was known for making vaginas outta pottery
I was cloned by others mocking me
Suddenly i grown 10 ft tall with Lurch Addams family drawers
The wars the spots with bear claws
People say sasquatch hasn't got nothing on me, i am Neanderthal

Testicles ready, penis already went through circumcision
Heavy competition, vocals just got out of the house of detention
Governor linebacking with the gold strap I play ball for Clinton
I'm like a dog chasing my own tail, spinning Dr. inclined
Jacked off in the mothership, pass the chip off the Funkenstein
The red dots ran over football players at the field goal line
Juicy inside, the girls like when I orange peel off their mind
If you can see ghosts I'm Shawn Carter in his prime

Women with newspaper peeing hard
Eyeballs get wide, everything grey and large
Master charge hold the condom with a iPod
Brain massage through my prostate, oh my god
Frank Fallujah see inside pink fuschia
DNA drop the birth control on computer
You wait for x-rays having sex with a neck brace
She on the autobahn speeding with a tampon
Hexagon, pulling over whilst she drinking a john

Norelco, I shave with a backhoe
Strippers on a ship man showing booty-hole

Move at the top-down out of all direction

Way beyond the fitted and the snapback

My wings make you look like atomic birds
Flying like a UFO with the rockets
They must be sniffing stardust in their show
Nasal so big I can fly aircraft up your nose
Raw vocal clouds like George, so Astro
With the largest selection of Texas Instruments
Who– spacewalk rappers like your microwave shoes
Young astronaut sit on the pot and tie my shoes
Find mysterious discoveries
The star don’t by all means
I’m still hot in space for many it’s a dream

Barney the purple dragon
Poppin the set, recline, faders
On the guest list with the Power Rangers
When way up in the nebula 18
It’s hard to find X when I stop on earth to entertain us
Tough floating gravity, you see the girls up here bathing
Even the movies in the head mess up the rocket
Your lady know what Shane Diesel did
You’re so low down, the flying saucer hover above your crib
Look out the aircraft I see you rolling the blunt like you big

The afro got me in tube socks looking like Dr. J
76-er in the Spectra with Qbert and Automator on the mixer
Muscle man aside watch me lift my own spaceship up
Your girl want my babies in a crystal cup
People say “how high you get?”
I got keys to flying trucks

Octa-god

I'm rap-ital, capital, just a moving, rapping animal
Punch straight like Zorro
How you want it—oral?
Watch me like porno, coming through the tube, innovative with my pubic hair braided
Tip-top shape, I'll make ER's doctors put on brakes
Friday the 13th, they bring my underwear from Crystal Lake
They want a Frito-Lay
Latino Ray with Dino J
My rhythm is sharp like a switchblade
Who' bitch made creamy, yellow, athletic, like the Oakland A's
Lord, I own the rings
Nine inches with ginseng, I'm not wasting time pretending
I'm doing steak right now, I'm serving you onion rings
Swing up, upscale watch me lift those barbells
Watch the pro throw four thousand pounds of fanmail
Step up if you' using fishscale, mini-goldfish
I'm a big whale—flipper!

Okay—I remove the robot to reprogram the plot against the onslaught
One wrong walk will leave you roadblocked
Homing from the dock, refers to how the flight
Get' path-locked by the magical mockery when you cockblock
I am you not, gotcha', talk to the hand
Backslapping yo' ass, crackin' yo' mask
I'll be happy to add my perverted inversion of language
With words during my display of pop-subversion
Undermine the system, distance myself from galaxies
Hell-bent on tragically typically mimicking fallacies
I was bespent, misrepresenting they' self
Down to the cell, microscopes couldn't have found the realm
Drown yourself, attempting to bad-mouth
You mad-foul, act like I knock smooth trash out
Don't act stupid 'cause I can prove that now
Act now while supplies last, as I black out

American disaster, fix the wall with plaster
Digitally I'm mastered, you can come in backwards
At work or playground, you see me at the synagogue
No time for blogs—Kennedy, call Leon!
Eradicate the spectrum, erecting the monument
Movin' the conglomerate, mood very ominous
Tomahawk hits—to the frontal lobe—who want it, though?
Fronting won't help you feel comfortable, humble yourself
You don't know Del, location on the under-stow
The dumbest of foes be excluded from comin' close
All the rest want to test, but I'm raw as flesh wounds
